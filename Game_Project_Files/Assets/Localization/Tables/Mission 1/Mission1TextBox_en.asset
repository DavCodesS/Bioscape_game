    m_Localized: Miltinho, there's this stream on the cattle property that's muddy
      and polluted, but I have no idea how...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1096529193660416
    m_Localized: I noticed that in that large pasture there were approximately 10
      cattle per 5 hectares, it seemed very spaced out and the grasses were practically
      non-existent, would you know the correct number of cattle per hectare?

    m_Localized: Miltinho, I noticed that there are fences left on the farm, could

    m_Localized: If you've seen footprints and chewed plants near the lake, it's
      very likely that the cattle are polluting the lake with soil and other contaminants
      such as feces.

    m_Localized: This method is known as extensive livestock farming, which uses
      a lot of land for very few animals. A more efficient method would be intensive
      livestock farming, where we could take all these cattle and put them on one
      hectare of land, confined. In other words, we need them to be closer together,
      just like when your mother tells you to keep your toys scattered around the
      room.

    m_Localized: 'When you go to the gym, don''t you get muscular? It''s the same
      principle with cattle: too much walking, especially on hills, results in this.'

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1100128778907648
    m_Localized: So since they're available, why don't you find a use for them?
    m_Metadata:

  - m_Id: 1100333691629568
    m_Localized: This plant is known as Common Lantana and is extremely toxic to
      cattle. The animal probably ate it because there was little pasture and because
      it had access to the stream.
